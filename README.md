# MineSweeper

A MineSweeper Clone 


## General Info
This javascript game was made during the fourth week of my _nology course where we were taught more about functions and DOM manipulation along with testing, aspects of which I've implemented within my own code-writing.

### Technologies used
HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript

## How it works
I made a MineSweeper clone using vanilla JavaScript. It cointains a Timer that counts down and ends the game at 0; the game also ends when a bomb is clicked just like the original MineSweeper game.
 
Steps to make game
==================
1. HTML, SCSS Boilerplate
2. JS defign variables to DOM
3. Create a Function to create the game board and all the items within.
4. Make arrays of bombs and non bombs.
5. Join both and randomize.
6. On click shows whats inside.
7. Bombs end the game.
8. Make a score counter.
9. Make a function that tells you the number of mines nearby. (If statments???).
10. Make a Timer that counts play time.



Bugs To Fix
===========
1. Buttons already clicked can be reclicked adding to the counter endlessly.
2. Buttons on the edge count mines in the edge of a diffenrt row.
3. No way to win the game - I will add the flag system in the future.
